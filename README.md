## Lyve 🪂
Lyve is event discovery application, using modern Android development techniques. The aim of the application is to connect people through a shared passion for different social activities where individuals can create their own profiles, add people as friends, create social activities, see/search activities around them and send a request to join.

## Architecture 🏗
The architecture of the application relies and compiles with following points:
* A single-activity architecture with [Navigation library](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to manage multiple fragment operations.
* [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) pattern to separate UI logic from business logic.
* [Android app architecture best practices](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) that allows the app to scale, increases the app's robustness, and makes the app easier to test.
